# Output of Question-3

This is a program to Calculate any two integers through Bitwise Operators.
We have a = 56 and b = 10
Now, using Bitwise Operators.
a&b =  8
a|b =  58
a^b =  50
Left shift both a and b with 2 bits gives 224 and 40 respectively.
Right shift 'a' with 2 bits and 'b' with 4 bits gives 14 and 0 respectively.
